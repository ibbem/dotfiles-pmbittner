# My Dotfiles as a Bare Git Repository

This repository contains all my linux configuration files I use for my personal setup, including for example Doom Emacs and Z Shell.

I created this repository according to [this guide](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) from Atlassian.

## Notes

- My terminal theme is `tokyonight-storm`
